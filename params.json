There is a nasty bug in the Raspberry Pi USB firmware causing the device to hang (http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=8010&p=158380). I hope this will be solved in few weeks :-)\r\n\r\nDone so far :\r\n\r\n* Added DGT XL clock message display to dgtnix driver\r\n* Added DGT board/clock support to Stockfish\r\n* Player can choose skill level\r\n* Player can choose computer thinking time\r\n* Allow to takeback moves\r\n* Software shutdown\r\n\r\n### Playing strength\r\n\r\nThis will be one of the strongest dedicated chess computer on the world :-)\r\nMy initial testing on Rasperry Pi hardware versus a 4 core Intel i7 shows we have grandmaster strength :) (http://lefounumerique.xooit.com/t1202-Stockfish-sur-Raspberry-Pi.htm)\r\n\r\n| Engine | Score | St |\r\n|:-------|:------|:---|\r\n| 1: Stockfish on Pi   | 40,0/100 | ···················· |\r\n| 2: Komodo3-64-sse    | 20,0/20  | 11111111111111111111 |\r\n| 3: Pharaon           | 14,0/20  | =1=1=101=110==110111 |\r\n| 4: AnMon 5.75        | 11,0/20  | ==1=1110=010==011001 |\r\n| 5: SOS 5.1 for Arena | 10,5/20  | 10001=10100111=001=1 |\r\n| 6: Gaia64            | 4,5/20   | 00100100010=00000100 |\r\n\r\n100 games played / Tournament is finished - Level: Blitz 2/1 - Hardware: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2405S CPU @ 2.50GHz with 8,0 GB Memory\r\n\r\nOn a 802MK II device, stockfish is running 5 times faster ! And there is a lot of space (1GB) for the hastables.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n* Add opening books, and allow opening book selection\r\n* Save games to PGN on the SD Card\r\n* Add more time controls, and display remaining time on the clock\r\n* Analysis mode\r\n\r\n### Help needed : SD card packaging\r\n\r\nI would like to provide a Linux sd card image that loads stockfish at boot time.\r\n\r\n### Help needed : documentation\r\n\r\nIf you have some english skills, I would like to provide a simple PDF sheet that explains how to use the board and the config modes.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n* [Opening Books](https://github.com/jromang/Stockfish/tree/dgt/books) by Gabriel Leperlier\r\n* Logo by pygmy_giant\r\n"}
