{"body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe goal the this project is to create a dedicated chess computer based on tiny ARM computers, the [Stockfish chess engine](http://www.stockfishchess.com), the [DGT eboard and DGT XL Clock](http://www.dgtprojects.com/), and the [dgtnix driver](http://dgtnix.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\n![MK802 II](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3042900/IMGP0232_r.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently the [Rikomagic MK 802 II](http://store.cloudsto.com/rikomagic/rikomagic-mk802-ii-detail.html) is supported , and I also plan to support the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nPicoChess v0.1 in working on the 802MK II ARM device.\r\nYou can see a [video of PicoChess running on a standard PC](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xt2eul_pichess_tech), and [running on a MK802 II ARM key](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xt4b85_pichess2_tech) :-) \r\n\r\nIt is not yet released for Raspberry Pi, because there is a nasty [bug](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=8010&p=158380) in the Raspberry Pi USB firmware causing the device to hang.\r\n\r\nDone so far :\r\n\r\n* Added DGT XL clock message display to dgtnix driver\r\n* Added DGT board/clock support to Stockfish\r\n* Player can choose skill level\r\n* Player can choose computer thinking time\r\n* Allow to takeback moves\r\n* Software shutdown\r\n* Add opening books, and allow opening book selection\r\n\r\n## Download and installation\r\n\r\nYou will have to download install the [PicoChess image file](http://www.lalmanach.info/picochess/picochess-MK802II-v0.1.7z) to a 8GB micro sd card.\r\n\r\nYou will need to unzip the image with [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and write it to a suitable SD card using the UNIX tool [dd](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/dd.1.html). Windows users should use [Win32DiskImager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer). Do not try to drag and drop or otherwise copy over the image without using dd or Win32DiskImager – it won’t work.\r\n\r\n#### Copying the image to an SD Card on Windows\r\n\r\n1. Insert the SD card into your SD card reader and check what drive letter it was assigned. You can easily see the drive letter (for example G:) by looking in the left column of Windows Explorer. If the card is not new, you should format it; otherwise Win32DiskImager may hang.\r\n1. Download the [Win32DiskImager utility](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer). The download links are on the right hand side of the page, you want the binary zip.\r\n1. Extract the executable from the zip file and run the Win32DiskImager utility. You may need to run the utility as Administrator.\r\n1. Select the picochess-MK802II-vx.x.img image file you extracted earlier\r\n1. Select the drive letter of the SD card in the device box. Be careful to select the correct drive; if you get the wrong one you can destroy your computer's hard disk!\r\n1. Click Write and wait for the write to complete.\r\n1. Exit the imager and eject the SD card.\r\n1. Insert the card in the MK802II, connect it to a DGT eboard and XL clock, power it on, and it should boot up with a nice 'Hello' message on the clock after 1-2 minutes.\r\n1. Play ! :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Playing strength\r\n\r\nThis will be one of the strongest dedicated chess computer on the world :-)\r\n[My initial testing](http://lefounumerique.xooit.com/t1202-Stockfish-sur-Raspberry-Pi.htm) on Rasperry Pi hardware versus a 4 core Intel i7 shows we have grandmaster strength :)\r\n\r\n| Engine | Score | St |\r\n|:-------|:------|:---|\r\n| 1: Stockfish on Pi   | 40,0/100 | ···················· |\r\n| 2: Komodo3-64-sse    | 20,0/20  | 11111111111111111111 |\r\n| 3: Pharaon           | 14,0/20  | =1=1=101=110==110111 |\r\n| 4: AnMon 5.75        | 11,0/20  | ==1=1110=010==011001 |\r\n| 5: SOS 5.1 for Arena | 10,5/20  | 10001=10100111=001=1 |\r\n| 6: Gaia64            | 4,5/20   | 00100100010=00000100 |\r\n\r\n100 games played / Tournament is finished - Level: Blitz 2/1 - Hardware: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2405S CPU @ 2.50GHz with 8,0 GB Memory\r\n\r\nOn a 802MK II device, stockfish is running 5 times faster ! And there is a lot of space (1GB) for the hastables.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n* Save games to PGN on the SD Card\r\n* Add more time controls, and display remaining time on the clock\r\n* Analysis mode\r\n\r\n## Help needed : documentation\r\n\r\nIf you have some english skills, I would like to provide a simple PDF sheet that explains how to use the board and the config modes.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* [Opening Books](https://github.com/jromang/Stockfish/tree/dgt/books) by Gabriel Leperlier\r\n* Logo by [pygmy_giant](http://www.nsd.uk.com/pages/home.html)\r\n\r\n![Logo](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3042900/PicoChess_logo_black_250.png)","note":"Don't delete this file!
