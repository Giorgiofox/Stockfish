Windows users should use [Win32DiskImager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer). Do not try to drag and drop or otherwise copy over the image without using dd or Win32DiskImager – it won’t work.\r\n\r\n#### Copying the image to an SD Card on Windows\r\n\r\n1. Insert the SD card into your SD card reader and check what drive letter it was assigned. You can easily see the drive letter (for example G:) by looking in the left column of Windows Explorer. If the card is not new, you should format it; otherwise Win32DiskImager may hang.\r\n1. Download the [Win32DiskImager utility](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer). The download links are on the right hand side of the page, you want the binary zip.\r\n1. Extract the executable from the zip file and run the Win32DiskImager utility. You may need to run the utility as Administrator.\r\n1. Select the picochess-MK802II/RaspberryPi-vx.x.img image file you extracted earlier\r\n1. Select the drive letter of the SD card in the device box. Be careful to select the correct drive; if you get the wrong one you can destroy your computer's hard disk!\r\n1. Click Write and wait for the write to complete.\r\n1. Exit the imager and eject the SD card.\r\n1. Insert the card in the MK802II/RaspberryPi, connect it to a DGT eboard and XL clock, power it on, and it should boot up with a nice 'Hello' message on the clock after 1-2 minutes.\r\n1. Play !\r\n\r\n## User manual\r\n\r\nHere is the [user manual wiki](https://github.com/jromang/Stockfish/wiki/Manual)\r\n\r\n## Playing strength\r\n\r\nThis will be one of the strongest dedicated chess computer on the world :-)\r\n[My initial testing](http://lefounumerique.xooit.com/t1202-Stockfish-sur-Raspberry-Pi.htm) on Rasperry Pi hardware versus a 4 core Intel i7 shows we have grandmaster strength :)\r\n\r\n| Engine | Score | St |\r\n|:-------|:------|:---|\r\n| 1: Stockfish on Pi   | 40,0/100 | ···················· |\r\n| 2: Komodo3-64-sse    | 20,0/20  | 11111111111111111111 |\r\n| 3: Pharaon           | 14,0/20  | =1=1=101=110==110111 |\r\n| 4: AnMon 5.75        | 11,0/20  | ==1=1110=010==011001 |\r\n| 5: SOS 5.1 for Arena | 10,5/20  | 10001=10100111=001=1 |\r\n| 6: Gaia64            | 4,5/20   | 00100100010=00000100 |\r\n\r\n100 games played / Tournament is finished - Level: Blitz 2/1 - Hardware: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2405S CPU @ 2.50GHz with 8,0 GB Memory\r\n\r\nOn a 802MK II device, stockfish is running 5 times faster !
